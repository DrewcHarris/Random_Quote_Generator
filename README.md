# Random Quote Generator

## Introduction

This is one of the projects required for the Front End Certificate at [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com). I wanted to use a minimalist design to achieve the objective which can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine), but the user stories include:
* I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
* I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

## Completed Project

You can view the fully working project on my [CodePen](http://codepen.io/drewharris/full/bBgExZ/).

## Random Quote API

I used the api from [forismatic](http://forismatic.com/en/api/) for the random quote aspect.  

## Credit

I wanted to thank [Stephen Mayeux](https://github.com/StephenMayeux) for his video tutorial which helped me step through the javascript and jQuery needed for this project.
